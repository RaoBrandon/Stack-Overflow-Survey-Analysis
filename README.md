# Stack-Overflow-Survey-Analysis

## Project Summary
<p>This project contains a notebook along with a complete Data Science project and analysis to illustrate some of the following concepts from the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program.</p>
<ol>
  <li>CRISP-DM compliance</li>
  <li>Dealing with missing data</li>
  <li>Steps to fitting, making predictions and evaluating a supervised machine learning model</li>

  <li>Sharing a compelling story by way of a Medium post</li>
</ol>

## File descriptions
<p>There is one python notebook within this repository that showcases the end-to-end analysis as summarized for business users in a Medium post available [here](https://medium.com/@brandonrao123/what-brings-job-satisfaction-for-a-developer-hint-its-not-money-031c383452cb).</p>

## Results
<p>Complete results of this analysis are shared within the project notebook as well as the medium post linked [here](https://medium.com/@brandonrao123/what-brings-job-satisfaction-for-a-developer-hint-its-not-money-031c383452cb).</p>
